### Project Description
In this Pygame project, players control a small red circle within a larger black circle, aiming to avoid boundary collisions while racing against a 9-second countdown timer. With simple controls and unpredictable bounces, it creates an engaging experience that tests reflexes and strategy

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
The project may face issues with collision detection accuracy and lack of player feedback during boundary collisions. Additionally, it could benefit from enhanced visuals and clearer instructions to improve user experience and engagement.
### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
To enhance the project, implement precise collision detection using bounding boxes and add visual/audio feedback for collisions. Additionally, include clear instructions and a reset option for a smoother user experience.

this screenshot depicts the initial stage of stimulation created by us which shows a ball trapped in a ring and the time left is 7 seconds

this screenshot depicts the middle stage of useless escape where the ball is still trapped in the ring and total time left to rescue the ball is 4 seconds

this screenshot depicts the last stage of useless escape where the user was not able to rescue the  ball from from the ring and time ends due to which user fails

### Project Demo
# Video
vedio shows stimulation of  ball trapped in a circular ring,which the user has to take out within 10 seconds otherwise the user will be failed due to time out.this vedio also has code written in pycharm using pyGame,on which the above stimulation is created
# Additional Demos
[Add any extra demo materials/links]
